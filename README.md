## Project Overview

This project analyzes climate and natural disaster data to identify spatial patterns and distributions across countries.
The objective is to transform raw datasets into clear, interpretable, and interactive visual outputs suitable for analytical exploration and web publication.

The main deliverable is an interactive HTML map deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Repository Structure

- Climate-Disasters-Data-Analysis  
  - data: raw and cleaned datasets  
  - notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization  
  - outputs  
    - maps: generated interactive HTML maps  
      - carte_catastrophes_pays.html  
  - docs: documentation and static assets  
  - README.md  

## Data Analysis Workflow

- Data ingestion and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Aggregation at country level
- Interactive map generation
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

## Live Demo

The interactive map generated by the project is publicly available.
